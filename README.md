### Getting Playlist Data

1. Create a Spotify account if you don't already have one and go to [Spotify's API Docs](https://beta.developer.spotify.com).

2. Open up Spotify Web Console and navigate to Playlists > Get a Playlist's Tracks

3. In your Spotify app, pick a playlist and click (...) > Share > Copy Spotify URI. Paste the URI anywhere and grab the playlist ID (`spotify:user:username:playlist:playlist_id`)

4. In the web console, fill in your `user_id` and `playlist_id` and put `items(track(name,id))` in `fields`.

5. Under `OAuth Token` click `GET TOKEN` and choose the default settings.

6. Copy paste the output and put it into a new file titled `songs.json`

### Getting Song Features

1. Open the file titled `tinker_starter.py`.

2. Get `song_ids` and `song_names` by parsing through `songs.json`.
```
for item in d['items']:
    song_ids.append(item['track']['id'])
    song_names.append(item['track']['name'])
```

3. Edit the `song_ids` to have no quotes and spaces. You can add a line `print(*song_ids, sep=',')` after you print the IDs if you are using Python 3.

4. In the [Spotify Web Console](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/console/get-audio-features-several-tracks/), navigate to Tracks > Get Audio Features for Several Tracks and enter the song ids.

5. Copy paste the output and save it to a file titled `features.json`.

6. Parse the values for each song feature from `features.json` as follows:
```
for feature in f['audio_features']:
    feature_ids['danceability'] = feature_ids.get('danceability',[])
    feature_ids['danceability'].append(feature['danceability']*100)
```
All features, except tempo, will be scaled by 100. We will store the values for tempo separately.

7. Store all of the songs and their corresponding tempos in a dictionary.
```
songs = {}
for song in song_names:
    for t in tempo:
        songs[song] = t
```

8. Calculate the averages of each feature.
```
avgs = {}
for k,v in feature_ids.items():
    sum = 0
    for val in v:
        sum += val
    avgs[k] = sum/len(v)
```

9. The final code for this section can be viewed at `tinker.py`.

### Visualizing the data

1. Create a new file `index.html` and set up the header with a page title and import ChartJS using this link as the source: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.4.0/Chart.min.js`


![Step 1](https://i.imgur.com/pTWFAYf.png)

2. In the body tags, add in the following lines:
```python
<body>
    <canvas id="songFeatures"></canvas>
    <canvas id="songTempos"></canvas>
</body>
```

3. Inside script tags, we will build our graphs. Start by creating an `averages` dictionary with the values you calculated in `tinker.py`. An example with our playlist is shown below:
```javascript
<script>
    var averages = {"danceability": 67.21851851851851, "energy": 64.74814814814815, "speechiness": 7.4185185185185185, "acousticness": 19.46912592592593, "liveness": 20.227407407407412, "valence": 49.025925925925925}
</script>
```

4. In a polarAreaChart variable, follow the structure on the [ChartJS documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/#creating-a-chart). This will create your first graph, showing the average feature value of songs in your selected playlist for each of the labels in the chart.

5. To create our tempo graph, create a variable titled barChart and set the labels to be an **array of song titles** in your playlist. Set the dataset to be the **array of tempos of the songs**, which you can get from the `tinker.py` file if you print out the `tempo` array.

6. To see your graphs on a webpage, just open `index.html` in a browser!

### Your turn to make something

Using what you've learned, Spotify's Web Console, and the ChartJS documentation, try making your own vizualizations now based on data that you're interested in!
